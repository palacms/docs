title: 'Inviting Collaborators'
description: 'Add team members and content editors to your Pala sites.'
---

Once your site is set up with page types and blocks, it's time to hand it off to content editors. This guide shows you how to invite collaborators, manage permissions, and ensure a smooth handoff.

## The Collaboration Model

Pala enables clean separation between developers and editors:

- **Developers** control structure, design, and available options
- **Editors** manage content, create pages, and publish
- **Both** work independently without breaking each other's work

<Info>
The goal: Mutual autonomy. Developers can update structure anytime, and editors can manage content without waiting for developers.
</Info>

## Inviting Collaborators

<Steps>
<Step title="Open site settings">
  Navigate to your site and click "Settings" in the sidebar.
</Step>

<Step title="Go to Team section">
  Click on "Team" or "Collaborators" to see current team members.
</Step>

<Step title="Click Invite">
  Click the "Invite Collaborator" button.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter email and role">
  Fill in the invitation form:

  - **Email**: The collaborator's email address
  - **Role**: Choose their permission level (Content Editor or Developer)
  - **Message** (optional): Add a personal note to the invitation

  <Tip>
  Include a message explaining what you want them to do: "I've set up the blog structure. You can start creating posts!"
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Send invitation">
  Click "Send Invitation". The collaborator receives an email with a link to accept.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
The invitation is sent! Your collaborator will receive an email with instructions to get started.
</Check>

## Roles and Permissions

Pala has two primary roles:

### Content Editor

**What they can do:**
- Create, edit, and delete pages
- Add and remove blocks (from available options)
- Edit block content
- Upload images and media
- Publish and unpublish pages
- View site analytics (if enabled)

**What they can't do:**
- Modify page types
- Change available blocks
- Edit component code
- Change site settings
- Invite other collaborators
- Access developer tools

<Tip>
Use the Content Editor role for content managers, copywriters, and anyone who only needs to manage pages.
</Tip>

### Developer

**What they can do:**
- Everything Content Editors can do, plus:
- Create and modify page types
- Add and configure blocks
- Change site settings
- Invite collaborators
- Manage team members
- Access developer tools
- Deploy and manage hosting

<Warning>
Developer access gives full control over the site, including the ability to break things. Only give Developer access to trusted developers or technical staff.
</Warning>

### Choosing the Right Role

**Use Content Editor role for:**
- Content writers
- Marketing team members
- Client staff managing their own content
- Anyone who only needs to create/edit pages

**Use Developer role for:**
- Developers
- Technical leads
- Agency staff managing client sites
- Anyone who needs to modify structure

## The Handoff Process

Follow these steps for a smooth developer-to-editor handoff:

### 1. Before Inviting

Prepare the site for editors:

<Steps>
<Step title="Set up page types">
  Create all necessary page types with:

  - Available blocks configured
  - Page fields defined
  - Header and footer slots set up
  - Helpful field labels and descriptions
</Step>

<Step title="Create example pages">
  Build 1-2 example pages for each page type:

  - Shows editors what's possible
  - Demonstrates best practices
  - Serves as templates to duplicate

  <Tip>
  Editors often duplicate example pages instead of starting from scratch. Make them good!
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Test the editor experience">
  Put yourself in the editor's shoes:

  - Can you build complete pages with available blocks?
  - Are field labels clear?
  - Is anything confusing or missing?
  - Do example pages look good?
</Step>

<Step title="Prepare documentation">
  Create a quick guide covering:

  - How to create each page type
  - Which blocks to use for what
  - Any specific guidelines (brand, tone, etc.)
  - Common tasks (publishing, adding images, etc.)

  <Info>
  You can share the [Using the Editor](/content-management/using-the-editor) guide from these docs as a starting point.
  </Info>
</Step>
</Steps>

### 2. During the Invitation

Make the invitation clear and helpful:

<Example>
**Good invitation message:**

"Hey Sarah! I've set up the blog structure for our site. You can start creating blog posts right away. I've added a few examples to show you what's possible. Check out the 'Blog Post' page type when creating new pages. Let me know if you need anything added!"

**Bad invitation message:**
"You're invited to edit the site."
</Example>

### 3. After They Accept

Follow up to ensure they're successful:

<Steps>
<Step title="Schedule a quick walkthrough">
  Spend 15-30 minutes showing them:

  - How to create their first page
  - Where to find example pages
  - How to add and edit blocks
  - How to publish when ready
</Step>

<Step title="Be available for questions">
  The first few days, be responsive to questions:

  - Answer quickly to avoid blockers
  - Note repeated questions (might indicate unclear design)
  - Offer to add features if they're struggling
</Step>

<Step title="Gather feedback">
  After they've created a few pages, ask:

  - What was confusing?
  - What blocks are you wishing you had?
  - What feels limiting?
  - What's working well?

  Use this feedback to improve page types and blocks.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Team Members

### Viewing Team Members

To see all collaborators on a site:

1. Open site settings
2. Go to Team section
3. View list of all members with their roles

### Changing Roles

To change a collaborator's role:

1. Find the team member in the list
2. Click on their role dropdown
3. Select the new role (Content Editor or Developer)
4. Confirm the change

<Warning>
Changing someone from Developer to Content Editor immediately removes their access to developer tools and settings.
</Warning>

### Removing Collaborators

To remove someone from the site:

1. Find them in the team list
2. Click the remove/delete icon
3. Confirm removal

<Info>
Removed collaborators lose all access to the site immediately. Their created content remains on the site.
</Info>

## Multi-Site Access

If you manage multiple sites, you can invite the same person to different sites:

- **Same role across sites**: Invite them with the same email to each site
- **Different roles per site**: They can be a Content Editor on one site and Developer on another
- **Separate permissions**: Access to one site doesn't grant access to others

<Tip>
This is useful for agencies managing client sites. You might be a Developer on all sites, but clients are Content Editors on only their own site.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Content Editor Role

When in doubt, start with the Content Editor role:

- Gives enough access for content work
- Protects site structure from accidents
- Can always upgrade to Developer later if needed

### 2. Create Clear Examples

Good example pages teach without documentation:

- Show all available blocks in use
- Demonstrate best practices
- Include helpful placeholder content
- Make them easy to duplicate

### 3. Provide Context in Invitations

A good invitation message includes:

- What you want them to do
- Where to start (which page types, examples)
- Who to ask if they have questions
- Any relevant guidelines or docs

### 4. Set Expectations Early

Be clear about:

- **What they can change**: Content, images, page structure (within page types)
- **What they can't change**: Design, colors, fonts, available blocks
- **How to request changes**: Who to ask for new features or blocks

### 5. Iterate Based on Usage

Watch how editors use the site:

- What do they struggle with?
- What do they ask for repeatedly?
- What blocks go unused?
- What workarounds are they creating?

Use this to improve page types and add helpful blocks.

## Common Scenarios

### Client Handoff

**Scenario**: Building a site for a client who will manage their own content

**Best approach:**
1. Build and configure everything as Developer
2. Create comprehensive examples for each page type
3. Invite client as Content Editor
4. Walk them through the basics (15-30 min)
5. Share documentation link
6. Be available for first few days
7. Schedule check-in after 1-2 weeks

### Team Collaboration

**Scenario**: Multiple content writers on your team

**Best approach:**
1. Invite all as Content Editors
2. Create clear examples for each content type
3. Establish content guidelines (tone, style, formatting)
4. Set up review process if needed
5. Use page status/drafts for collaboration

### Agency Multi-Site

**Scenario**: Managing many client sites

**Best approach:**
1. You're Developer on all sites
2. Each client is Content Editor on their own site only
3. Use consistent page type patterns across sites
4. Create a reusable library of blocks
5. Document common processes for efficiency

### Developer Team

**Scenario**: Multiple developers working on one site

**Best approach:**
1. All developers have Developer role
2. Communicate changes to page types/structure
3. Test thoroughly before deploying
4. Use version control for code
5. Coordinate on block library changes

## Troubleshooting

### Invitation Not Received

**Problem**: Collaborator didn't get the email

**Solutions**:
- Check spam/junk folder
- Verify email address is correct
- Resend the invitation
- Check if email service is blocking

### Content Editor Can't Find Blocks

**Problem**: "I need X block but I don't see it"

**Solution**:
- Add the block to the page type's available blocks
- Or explain which available block to use instead

### Content Editor Wants to Change Design

**Problem**: "Can I change the colors/fonts?"

**Solution**:
- Explain that design is controlled by you (developer)
- Offer to make the change for them
- If it's a common request, consider adding it as a configurable option (site field or block field)

### Too Many Requests

**Problem**: Content editor constantly asking for changes

**Solutions**:
- Review their requests for patterns
- Add commonly requested blocks to page types
- Make fields more flexible if appropriate
- Set expectations about what's configurable vs. fixed

### Accidental Deletion

**Problem**: Content editor deleted something important

**Solution**:
- Check if there's a backup or revision history (if enabled)
- Recreate from example page if available
- For future: educate on being careful with deletions
- Consider more restrictive permissions if repeated issue

<Tip>
The best collaborations start with clear communication. Explain what you've built, what editors can do, and how to ask for help. A good 15-minute walkthrough saves hours of confusion later.
