The Sites dashboard helps you organize and manage all your Pala sites in one place.

## Creating Your First Site

When you first access Pala from a domain, you'll be prompted to create a site for that hostname. The site is automatically tied to the domain you accessed it from.

## Creating Additional Sites

To create additional sites, you need to connect them to new domain names:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect a new domain to your server">
    Point your domain's DNS records to your Pala server, or configure your hosting provider to route traffic to the server.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access the server from the new domain">
    Visit your new domain in a web browser (e.g., `https://newsite.com`).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Sign in and create the site">
    You'll be shown the site creation screen. Complete the setup and your site will be automatically connected to the domain.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Each site is tied to a specific hostname/domain. You cannot have multiple sites on the same domain.

## Site Groups

**Site Groups** help you organize multiple sites into folders. They're purely organizational - they don't affect how sites function.

### Common Use Cases

- **Client Organization**: Group sites by client (e.g., "Client A Sites", "Client B Sites")
- **Project Type**: Organize by type (e.g., "Blogs", "Portfolios", "E-commerce")
- **Work Status**: Separate sites by stage (e.g., "In Development", "Live Sites", "Personal Projects")

### Managing Site Groups

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a group">
    From the Sites dashboard, site groups are created automatically when you first access the dashboard. You can rename them as needed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Move sites between groups">
    Click the three-dot menu on any site → "Move" → Select the destination group.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Rename a group">
    Click the dropdown next to the group name → "Rename".
  </Step>

  <Step title="Delete a group">
    Click the dropdown next to the group name → "Delete".
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Deleting a site group deletes all sites within it. Move sites out of a group before deleting it if you want to keep them.
</Warning>

## Managing Individual Sites

Each site card in the dashboard provides quick actions:

**Rename**: Change the site's display name (doesn't affect the domain)

**Move**: Move the site to a different group

**Download**: Export the site's data (coming soon)

**Delete**: Permanently delete the site and all its content

<Warning>
Deleting a site is permanent and cannot be undone. All pages, blocks, and content will be lost.
</Warning>
