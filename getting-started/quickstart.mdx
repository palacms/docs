Starters give you a head start with pre-configured page types, blocks, and sample content.

<Step title="Pick a starter source">
  Choose where to get your starter from:

  **Your Existing Sites:**

## Step 3: Add Additional Blocks (Optional)

You can add extra blocks to your site from your server library or the marketplace.

<Steps>
<Step title="Browse available blocks">

When you're ready to go live:

<Steps>
<Step title="Review your changes">
  Use the preview to see how your site looks.
</Step>

<Step title="Publish">
  Click "Publish" (or press ⌘P). Pala will:

  - Generate static HTML
  - Deploy to your domain

  <Check>
  Your site is now live!
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Pala generates static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for fast performance. For further optimization, run your site through [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) to identify improvements like image compression and WebP formats.
</Info>

## Accessing Your Site

Your site is published and hosted from the same domain:

- **Live site**: `https://yourdomain.com/`
- **Pala admin**: `https://yourdomain.com/admin/`

<Tip>
The admin panel is always at `/admin/` on your domain. Your published site lives at the root.
