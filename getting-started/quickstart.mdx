This quickstart guide walks you through creating your first Pala site, building a simple block, and publishing it. You'll have a live site in under 10 minutes.

<Info>
This guide assumes you've completed [installation](/getting-started/installation). If you haven't, start there first.
</Info>

## Step 1: Create Your First Site

When you first access Pala, you'll see the site creation screen. Here's what to do:

<Steps>
<Step title="Enter site details">
  Provide a name for your site. This is for internal organization and won't appear on your published site.
  
  <Check>
  The site name can be changed later in settings.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure your domain">
  If you're using Pala Cloud, your site will be available at a subdomain. For self-hosted installations, enter your domain name.
  
  <Warning>
  For self-hosted installations, make sure your DNS is configured to point to your server before creating the site.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Complete site creation">
  Click "Create Site" to initialize your new site. Pala will set up the database and default configuration.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
Your site is created! You'll now see your site dashboard with options to create page types, build blocks, and manage content.
</Check>

## Step 2: Create a Page Type

Page types define what kind of pages editors can create. Let's create a simple "Homepage" page type:

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to page types">
  In your site dashboard, click "Page Types" in the sidebar, then click "Create Page Type".
</Step>

<Step title="Configure the page type">
  - **Name**: "Homepage"
  - **Description**: "Landing page for the site"
  - **Slug**: "homepage" (used in URLs)
  
  <Info>
  The slug determines the URL structure. A page of this type will be accessible at `/homepage` by default.
  </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Set available blocks">
  For now, leave the available blocks empty. We'll add blocks in the next step after we create one.
  
  Click "Create" to save the page type.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
Your "Homepage" page type is created and ready. Next, we'll build a block to use with it.
</Check>

## Step 3: Build Your First Block

Blocks are the building blocks of your pages. Let's create a simple Hero block:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the component editor">
  Click "Component Library" in the sidebar, then "Create Block". This opens the in-browser code editor.
</Step>

<Step title="Write the component code">
  Replace the default code with a simple Hero component:
  
  ```svelte
  <script>
    // Content fields will be added here
  </script>
  
  <section class="hero">
    <h1>Welcome to Pala</h1>
    <p>Build beautiful sites with code and content together.</p>
    <a href="/about" class="button">Get Started</a>
  </section>
  
  <style>
    .hero {
      padding: 4rem 2rem;
      text-align: center;
      background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
      color: white;
    }
    
    .hero h1 {
      font-size: 3rem;
      margin-bottom: 1rem;
    }
    
    .hero p {
      font-size: 1.25rem;
      margin-bottom: 2rem;
      opacity: 0.9;
    }
    
    .button {
      display: inline-block;
      padding: 0.75rem 2rem;
      background: white;
      color: #667eea;
      text-decoration: none;
      border-radius: 0.5rem;
      font-weight: 600;
      transition: transform 0.2s;
    }
    
    .button:hover {
      transform: translateY(-2px);
    }
  </style>
  ```
  
  <Tip>
  The editor provides syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and instant preview. Make changes and see them update in real-time.
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Add content fields">
  Now let's make the text editable by adding fields. Click "Add Field" and create:
  
  - **Field name**: `headline` (Text field)
  - **Field name**: `subheadline` (Text field)
  - **Field name**: `cta_text` (Text field)
  - **Field name**: `cta_link` (Text field)

  Fields are automatically available in your component—just reference them:

  ```svelte
  <section class="hero">
    <h1>{headline}</h1>
    <p>{subheadline}</p>
    <a href={cta_link} class="button">{cta_text}</a>
  </section>

  <style>
    /* ... existing styles ... */
  </style>
  ```
</Step>

<Check>
Your component now has editable fields. Editors can change the headline, subheadline, and CTA text without touching code.
</Check>

<Step title="Save the block">
  Click "Save Block" and give it a name: "Hero". This adds it to your component library.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
Your Hero block is saved to your component library and ready to use across all your sites.
</Check>

## Step 4: Add the Block to Your Page Type

Now let's make this block available for editors to use:

<Steps>
<Step title="Edit the page type">
  Go back to "Page Types" and click on your "Homepage" page type to edit it.
</Step>

<Step title="Add available blocks">
  In the "Available Blocks" section, click "Add Block" and select your "Hero" block.
  
  <Info>
  You can add multiple blocks here. Editors will be able to choose from any block you make available.
  </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Save changes">
  Click "Save" to update the page type.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
Your page type now includes the Hero block. Editors can now use it when creating pages.
</Check>

## Step 5: Create Your First Page

Now let's create an actual page using the page type we just set up:

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a new page">
  Click "Pages" in the sidebar, then "Create Page".
</Step>

<Step title="Choose page type">
  Select "Homepage" as the page type.
</Step>

<Step title="Add the Hero block">
  Click "Add Block" and select "Hero" from the available blocks.
</Step>

<Step title="Edit the content">
  Click on the Hero block to open the editor. You'll see form fields for:
  - Headline
  - Subheadline
  - CTA Text
  - CTA Link
  
  Fill in your content:
  - **Headline**: "Welcome to My Site"
  - **Subheadline**: "Built with Pala CMS"
  - **CTA Text**: "Learn More"
  - **CTA Link**: "/about"
  
  <Tip>
  You can also use the visual editor to see your changes in real-time as you type.
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Save the page">
  Click "Save" to save your page as a draft, or "Publish" to make it live immediately.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
Your first page is created with the Hero block! You can now preview it or publish it to make it live.
</Check>

## Step 6: Publish Your Site

Your page is ready to go live:

<Steps>
<Step title="Review your page">
  Use the preview feature to see how your page looks before publishing.
</Step>

<Step title="Publish">
  Click "Publish" on your page. Pala will generate a static site and deploy it.
  
  <Check>
  Your site is now live! Visit the URL shown in your site settings to see it.
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Pala generates static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for maximum performance. Your site is automatically optimized for SEO and speed.

## Common Next Steps

- **Add more blocks**: Create Text, Image, and Call-to-Action blocks to build richer pages
- **Create more page types**: Set up Blog Post, About, and Contact page types
- **Customize styling**: Use CSS variables in your site settings to create a design system
- **Invite editors**: Add team members who can create and edit content without touching code

<Tip>
The component library stores all your blocks. Once created, they're available across all your sites, making it easy to build a personal library of reusable components.
