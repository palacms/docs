Pala offers two installation options: a hosted cloud platform for managed hosting, or self-hosting for full control over your infrastructure.

<Tabs>
	<Tab title="Cloud (Recommended)">

	<Tab title="Self-Hosted">
		## Self-Hosted Installation

		Run Pala on your own infrastructure for complete control. Ideal for teams with specific security, compliance, or customization requirements.

		Pala's architecture is intentionally simple—a single monolithic application with a SQLite database. This means self-hosting requires minimal operational overhead. No complex microservices, separate database servers, or distributed systems to manage.

		<Warning>
			**Persistent Storage Required**: Pala stores all code, content, and data in a SQLite database that requires persistent disk storage. It will NOT work on serverless platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or Cloudflare Pages.
		</Warning>

		### Choose Your Hosting Path

		Select the approach that matches your technical comfort level and requirements. All options can run Pala for **$5-7/month**.

		<Tip>
		**New to self-hosting?** Start with [Railway](https://railway.com/?referralCode=RCPU7k) or Fly.io for the easiest setup. If you need more control or lower costs at scale, consider VPS hosting.
		</Tip>

		<Tabs>
			<Tab title="Managed Platforms (Easiest)">
				**What you get:** One-click deployment, automatic SSL, managed infrastructure. No server management required.

			</Tab>

			<Tab title="VPS Hosting (Most Control)">

		<Info>
			**Quick start:** If you just want to try Pala, click the [Railway deploy button](https://railway.com/deploy/palacms?referralCode=RCPU7k) for instant setup. For production sites or when you need full control, choose the VPS path.
		</Info>

		<Accordion title="Local Development (Optional)">
			For contributing to Pala or testing locally:

			- **devenv** ([install here](https://devenv.sh/)) or **Dev Container** compatible environment (VS Code)
			- **Node.js 22+** and **npm**
			- **Git**

			**Local Development Steps:**

			<Steps>
				<Step title="Clone the repository">
					```bash
					git clone https://github.com/palacms/palacms.git
					cd palacms
					```
				</Step>

				<Step title="Install dependencies">
					```bash
					npm install
					```
				</Step>

				<Step title="Build the application">
					```bash
					npm run build
					```
					<Info>
						Initial build is required before starting the dev server.
					</Info>
				</Step>

				<Step title="Start development server">
					```bash
					npm run dev
					```
				</Step>

				<Step title="Access the application">
					- Main app (dev): [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
					- Built app: [http://localhost:8090](http://localhost:8090)
					- PocketBase Admin: [http://localhost:8090/_](http://localhost:8090/_)
				</Step>
			</Steps>

			<Warning>
				Local development is for testing only. All code and content is stored in the database, so you'll need a persistent server environment for production use.
			</Warning>
		</Accordion>

		### Manual Deployment (VPS & Custom Infrastructure)

		<Info>
			**Using [Railway](https://railway.com/?referralCode=RCPU7k) or Fly.io?** You can skip this section - those platforms handle Docker deployment automatically.
		</Info>

		For VPS hosting (Hetzner, DigitalOcean, etc.) or custom infrastructure, deploy Pala as a Docker container using Docker Compose or by running Docker commands directly. See the [PocketBase production deployment guide](https://pocketbase.io/docs/going-to-production/) for additional information.

		<Steps>
			<Step title="Point your domain to the server">
				Configure your DNS to point your domain name to the server where you'll host Pala CMS.
			</Step>

			<Step title="Prepare Docker deployment">
				Use Docker Compose (recommended) or run Docker commands directly. Use `ghcr.io/palacms/palacms:latest` as the image.

				**Required volume**: Add a volume for the path `/app/pb_data`. This is where all files and the database will be stored.

				**Optional environment variables** (only take effect on first start):
				- `PALA_APP_URL` - Sets base URL used for generating links in the backend (e.g., emails)
				- `PALA_SUPERUSER_EMAIL` + `PALA_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD` - Creates initial superuser account
				- `PALA_USER_EMAIL` + `PALA_USER_PASSWORD` - Creates initial user account

				<CodeGroup>
					```yaml:compose.yaml
					services:
					  palacms:
					    image: ghcr.io/palacms/palacms:latest
					    restart: always
					    ports:
					      - 8080:8080
					    volumes:
					      - palacms-data:/app/pb_data
					    # Optional environment variables:
					    # environment:
					    #   - PALA_APP_URL=https://example.com
					    #   - PALA_SUPERUSER_EMAIL=admin@example.com
					    #   - PALA_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=secure-password
					    #   - PALA_USER_EMAIL=user@example.com
					    #   - PALA_USER_PASSWORD=secure-password

					volumes:
					  palacms-data:
					```

					```bash:docker run
					docker run -d \
					  --name palacms \
					  --restart always \
					  -p 8080:8080 \
					  -v palacms-data:/app/pb_data \
					  ghcr.io/palacms/palacms:latest
					```
				</CodeGroup>
			</Step>

			<Step title="Complete setup">
				Navigate to your domain name to complete setup. Setup only starts if a superuser was not created using environment variables in the previous step.
			</Step>

			<Step title="Configure PocketBase">
				Configure PocketBase settings by navigating to `https://your-domain.com/_/` (replace with your domain).
			</Step>

			<Step title="Create your first site">
				Create your first site by navigating to `https://your-domain.com/admin` (replace with your domain). Note that the site is created using the domain name used to access the CMS.
