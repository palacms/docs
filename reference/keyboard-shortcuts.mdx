Pala's keyboard shortcuts are built around the modifier key (⌘ on Mac, Ctrl on Windows/Linux). When you hold the modifier key, relevant UI elements appear showing you what other keys to press.

<Info>
Throughout this page, we use ⌘ to represent Cmd on Mac or Ctrl on Windows/Linux.

## Global Shortcuts

These shortcuts work anywhere in Pala, **except when a dialog is open**:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| ⌘P | Open publish dialog (press again to publish) |
| ⌘↑ | Navigate to previous page (same level) |
| ⌘↓ | Navigate to next page (same level) |

<Tip>
⌘P is your quickest way to publish. Press once to open the dialog, press again to confirm and publish.
</Tip>

## Page View Shortcuts

While viewing a page in the editor:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| ⌘E | Open section dialog (when hovering over a block) |

## Section & Block Editor Dialog

While editing a section or block in the dialog:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| ⌘S | Save changes |
| ⌘E | Toggle between Code and Content tabs |
| Esc | Close dialog |

**Code Editor** (when in the Code tab):

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| ⌘1 | Switch to HTML pane |
| ⌘2 | Switch to CSS pane |
| ⌘3 | Switch to JavaScript pane |
| ⌘Enter | Format active code pane |

<Info>
Pala uses CodeMirror for code editing. Some standard code editor shortcuts may work, but they're not guaranteed.

## Site Editor Dialog

While editing site configuration:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| ⌘S | Save changes |

## Tips for Efficiency

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Hold the modifier key to see available shortcuts">
    When you hold ⌘/Ctrl, Pala shows you contextual hints for what shortcuts are available in your current view.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use ⌘1/2/3 to switch code panes">
    Instead of clicking each pane tab individually, use ⌘1 for HTML, ⌘2 for CSS, and ⌘3 for JavaScript. This makes editing much faster.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use ⌘E to bounce between code and content">
    When editing blocks, quickly switch between writing code and previewing content without reaching for the mouse.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Publish often with ⌘P">
    Make it a habit to publish frequently. Press once to open the dialog, press again to publish. Quick iterations help catch issues early.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Navigate pages with arrow keys">
    When managing many pages, use ⌘↑/↓ to move through them quickly.
  </Accordion>
