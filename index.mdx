## The Problem Pala Solves

Traditional website development creates tension between developers and content editors:

- Developers need code control and modern tooling
- Clients need a simple, visual editing experience
- WordPress lets clients break designs
- Headless CMSs have terrible client UX
- Webflow is expensive and limiting

Pala solves this by coupling code and content in self-contained blocks that live together and can be used and updated visually by non-technical content editors.

## Who It's For

Pala is perfect for:

- Freelancers building sites for local businesses

- Anyone tired of "the website broke 😩" texts

## Why Svelte?

Pala blocks are written in Svelte, a modern component framework. If you're new to Svelte, the [official tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial) covers everything you need to know.

**Benefits of Svelte:**

- Simple syntax built on top of HTML, CSS, and JS
- Scoped styles (no CSS conflicts across components)
- Reactive JavaScript using runes (\$state, \$derived, \$effect)
- Fast performance with small bundle sizes
