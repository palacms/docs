---

This guide is for content editors who create and manage pages in Pala. You'll learn how to create pages, add blocks, edit content, and publish your work—all without touching any code.

<Info>
If you're a developer setting up Pala, share this guide with your content editors to help them get started.
</Info>

## Getting Started

When you log into Pala, you'll see the dashboard with your sites. Click on a site to start editing.

### The Editor Interface

The Pala editor has three main areas:

1. **Sidebar** - Navigation and page list
2. **Content Area** - Where you edit pages and blocks
3. **Toolbar** - Actions like save, publish, and preview

<Tip>
You can resize panels and collapse the sidebar to get more editing space.
</Tip>

## Creating Pages

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Pages">
  Click "Pages" in the sidebar to see all existing pages.
</Step>

<Step title="Create a new page">
  Click the "Create Page" button at the top of the pages list.
</Step>

<Step title="Choose a page type">
  Select the type of page you want to create (e.g., "Blog Post", "Landing Page").
  
  <Info>
  The page type determines which blocks you can use and what fields are available. Your developer sets up page types.
  </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Set page details">
  Fill in the page-level fields:
  - **Title**: The page title (appears in navigation and SEO)
  - **Slug**: URL-friendly version of the title (auto-generated from title)
  - **Other fields**: Any additional fields your developer has set up
  
  <Tip>
  The slug is what appears in the URL. "My Great Article" becomes "my-great-article" in the URL.
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Start adding blocks">
  Click "Add Block" to start building your page content.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Working with Blocks

Blocks are the building blocks of your pages. Each block is a section of content you can edit.

### Adding Blocks

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the block menu">
  Click "Add Block" anywhere on your page. You'll see a list of available blocks.
</Step>

<Step title="Select a block">
  Choose the block type you want to add (e.g., "Text", "Image", "Hero").
  
  <Info>
  The blocks you see depend on what your developer has made available for this page type.
  </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="The block appears">
  Your new block appears on the page, ready for you to edit.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
The block is added to your page. Click on it to start editing the content.
</Check>

### Editing Block Content

<Steps>
<Step title="Click on a block">
  Click anywhere on a block to select it and open the editor.
</Step>

<Step title="Edit the fields">
  You'll see form fields for that block:
  - **Text fields**: Type directly
  - **Rich text fields**: Use the formatting toolbar
  - **Image fields**: Upload or select an image
  - **Link fields**: Enter URLs
  
  <Tip>
  Changes appear in real-time in the preview. You can see how your content looks as you type.
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Save your changes">
  Click outside the block or press Escape to save. Changes are saved automatically.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
Your changes are saved automatically. You can continue editing or add more blocks.
</Check>

### Reordering Blocks

You can change the order of blocks on your page:

<Steps>
<Step title="Select a block">
  Click on the block you want to move.
</Step>

<Step title="Use drag handles">
  Look for the drag handle (⋮⋮) on the left side of the block.
</Step>

<Step title="Drag to reorder">
  Click and hold the drag handle, then drag the block up or down to its new position.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
Blocks stack vertically on the page. The order you see in the editor is the order they'll appear on the published page.
</Check>

### Deleting Blocks

To remove a block:

1. Click on the block to select it
2. Look for the delete button (trash icon) in the block toolbar
3. Click delete and confirm

<Warning>
Deleting a block is permanent. Make sure you want to remove it before confirming.
</Warning>

## Visual vs Form Editing

Pala offers two ways to edit content:

<Tip>
**Not sure which to use?** Start with the visual editor to see your changes in real-time. Switch to form editing when you need to quickly fill in many fields at once.
</Tip>

### Visual Editor

The visual editor shows your page as it will appear to visitors:

- See exactly how content looks
- Edit directly on the page
- Real-time preview of changes
- Better for layout and design

<Tip>
Use the visual editor when you want to see how everything looks together.
</Tip>

### Form Editor

The form editor shows all fields in a structured form:

- See all fields at once
- Edit multiple fields quickly
- Better for content-heavy pages
- Easier to fill in all fields

<Tip>
Use the form editor when you're focused on entering content rather than seeing the layout.
</Tip>

### Switching Between Views

Toggle between visual and form editing using the view switcher in the toolbar. Your content is the same in both views—just a different way of editing it.

## Saving and Publishing

### Saving Drafts

Your work is saved automatically as you edit. You can also manually save:

1. Click "Save" in the toolbar
2. Your page is saved as a draft
3. Drafts aren't visible to visitors

<Info>
Drafts let you work on content without making it public. You can save multiple drafts and publish when ready.
</Info>

### Publishing Pages

When your page is ready to go live:

<Steps>
<Step title="Review your page">
  Use the preview feature to see how your page looks before publishing.
</Step>

<Step title="Click Publish">
  Click the "Publish" button in the toolbar.
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm publication">
  Review the confirmation dialog and click "Publish" to make it live.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
Your page is now live and visible to visitors!
</Check>

### Unpublishing Pages

To take a page offline:

1. Open the page you want to unpublish
2. Click "Unpublish" in the toolbar
3. Confirm the action

<Warning>
Unpublishing makes the page invisible to visitors, but it's still saved in Pala. You can republish it later.
</Warning>

<Steps>
<Step title="Open image field">
  Click on an image field in any block.
</Step>

<Step title="Upload image">
  Click "Upload" and select an image from your computer, or drag and drop an image into the upload area.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
Your image is uploaded and ready to use. Don't forget to add alt text for accessibility.

<Tip>
Pala automatically optimizes images, but starting with well-sized images helps performance.
</Tip>

## Working with Links

### Adding Links

<Steps>
<Step title="Select text or element">
  In a text field, select the text you want to link, or click on a link field.
</Step>

<Step title="Add the URL">
  Enter the URL:

</Step>

<Step title="Set link options">
  For external links, you can choose to open in a new tab.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
Your link is set up. Test it in the preview to make sure it works correctly.
</Check>

### Link Types

- **Page links**: Link to other pages on your site (use page slugs)
- **External links**: Link to other websites (use full URLs)
- **Email links**: Use `mailto:email@example.com`
- **Anchor links**: Link to sections on the same page (use `#section-id`)

## Tips for Effective Editing

### 1. Use Preview Regularly

Preview your page frequently to see how it looks to visitors:

- Check spacing and layout
- Verify images display correctly
- Test links
- Review on different screen sizes

### 2. Save Often

While Pala auto-saves, manually saving gives you peace of mind:

- Save before making major changes
- Save when switching between pages
- Save before publishing

### 3. Use Blocks Strategically

- **Hero blocks**: Great for landing pages and important announcements
- **Text blocks**: Use for articles, descriptions, and content
- **Image blocks**: Break up text and add visual interest
- **Card grids**: Perfect for features, team members, or products

### 4. Keep Content Organized

- Use clear, descriptive page titles
- Add helpful slugs (URL-friendly names)
- Fill in all relevant fields
- Use consistent formatting

### 5. Test Before Publishing

Always preview before publishing:

- Check all links work
- Verify images load correctly
- Read through content for typos
- Test on mobile if possible

## Troubleshooting

### Block Not Appearing

If a block doesn't appear after adding it:

- Check if it's below the visible area (scroll down)
- Refresh the page
- Contact your developer if the issue persists

### Changes Not Saving

If your changes aren't saving:

- Check your internet connection
- Look for error messages
- Try saving manually
- Refresh and try again

### Can't Find a Block

If you can't find a block you need:

- Check what blocks are available for your page type
- Ask your developer to add the block to the page type
- Use a similar block if available

### Images Not Uploading

If images won't upload:

- Check file size (should be under 2MB)
- Verify file format (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
- Check your internet connection
- Try a different image

## Getting Help
