description: 'Understand the difference between viewing blocks on-page and editing in the form dialog.'

Pala offers two ways to work with content: viewing blocks visually on the page, or opening them in the editor dialog to edit fields.

## Visual View (On-Page)

The visual view shows your page as it will appear to visitors.

**What you see:**
- All blocks stacked vertically
- How content looks in context
- Spacing, layout, and design

**What you can do:**
- Hover over blocks to see the toolbar
- Drag blocks to reorder them
- Click "Edit" to open the form dialog
- Delete blocks
- Add new blocks via drag-and-drop from sidebar

<Tip>
Use the visual view to see how your page looks and to rearrange blocks.
</Tip>

## Form Editor (Dialog)

Click "Edit" in the block toolbar to open the editor dialog.

**Content Tab:**
- Shows all fields in a structured form
- Edit text, images, links, etc.
- Scroll through all fields
- See what's filled in and what's empty

**Code Tab** (developers only):
- Edit HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- See live preview
- Toggle with `Cmd/Ctrl + E`

<Info>
Content editors only see the Content tab. Developers can switch between Content and Code tabs.

## When to Use Each

**Use Visual View When:**
- Building page layouts
- Rearranging blocks
- Checking how content looks
- Adding or removing blocks

**Open Form Editor When:**
- Editing block content
- Filling in multiple fields
- Updating text, images, links
- Need to see all fields at once

## Workflow

Typical editing flow:

1. **Start in visual view** - See the full page
2. **Hover over a block** - Toolbar appears
3. **Click "Edit"** - Form dialog opens
4. **Fill in fields** - Edit content in Content tab
5. **Save** - Changes appear on page
6. **Repeat** - Edit more blocks as needed

<Tip>
You can also press `Cmd/Ctrl + E` while hovering over a block to quickly open the editor dialog.
