Publishing compiles your blocks into static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and deploys them to your domain.

## How It Works

When you publish, Pala:

1. Compiles all blocks to optimized JavaScript
2. Generates static HTML for every page
3. Copies assets to the output directory
4. Deploys files to your domain

Your site is accessible at `https://yourdomain.com/` while the admin stays at `https://yourdomain.com/admin/`.

## Publishing a Site

<Steps>
<Step title="Click Publish">
  In the toolbar, click "Publish" (or press `Cmd/Ctrl + P`).
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm">
  In the dialog, click "Publish Changes" to confirm.
</Step>

<Step title="Wait for completion">
  Publishing typically takes 10-30 seconds. You'll see a success message when done.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
Your site is now live at your domain.
</Check>

## What Gets Published

Every publish includes:

- All pages
- All blocks (recompiled)
- All assets (images, files)
- Site configuration

<Tip>
Even if you only change one thing, Pala rebuilds the entire site to ensure consistency.
</Tip>

## Auto-Save Behavior

Most changes auto-save:
- Page content edits
- Adding/removing blocks
- Reordering blocks

**Manual save required for:**
- Block editor (code/fields)
- Section editor
- Site settings editor

<Warning>
Always save in the block/section/site editor before publishing.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

**Publish fails with an error:**
- Check the error message for the specific block or page causing the issue
- Review recent changes
- Fix the issue and try again

**Changes don't appear on live site:**
- Hard refresh your browser (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R`)
- Wait 1-2 minutes for propagation
- Verify you clicked "Publish Changes" in the dialog

**Images not loading:**
- Verify images were uploaded (not just linked externally)
- Republish to ensure assets were copied
