The Component Library is your personal collection of reusable blocks. Once you create a block, it's saved to your library and available across all your sites. This guide covers managing your library, reusing blocks, and exploring the marketplace.

## What is the Component Library?

The Component Library stores all the blocks you create:

- **Blocks you build** - Your custom components
- **Available everywhere** - Use blocks in any site
- **Version controlled** - Track changes and updates
- **Shareable** - Export and import blocks

<Info>
Blocks in your library are independent of sites. Create a block once, use it in multiple sites, update it everywhere at once.
</Info>

## Managing Your Library

### Viewing Your Blocks

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Component Library">
  Click "Component Library" in the sidebar of any site.
</Step>

<Step title="Browse your blocks">
  You'll see all blocks you've created, organized by:
  - **Recently used** - Blocks you've used recently
  - **All blocks** - Complete list of your blocks
  - **Categories** - If you've organized them
  
  <Tip>
  Use the search bar to quickly find blocks by name or description.
  </Tip>
</Step>
</Steps>

### Creating New Blocks

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a new block">
  Click "Create Block" in the Component Library.
</Step>

<Step title="Write your component">
  Use the in-browser editor to write your component code.
  
  <Info>
  The editor provides syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and instant preview.
  </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Add fields">
  Attach content fields to make the block editable.
  
  <Tip>
  See the [Working with Fields](/building-sites/working-with-fields) guide for details.
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Save to library">
  Click "Save Block" and give it a name. The block is now in your library.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Editing Existing Blocks

<Steps>
<Step title="Find the block">
  Browse or search for the block you want to edit.
</Step>

<Step title="Open the block">
  Click on the block to open it in the editor.
</Step>

<Step title="Make changes">
  Update the component code, fields, or settings as needed.
</Step>

<Step title="Save changes">
  Click "Save" to update the block.
  
  <Warning>
  Changes to blocks affect all sites using that block. Test changes carefully.
  </Warning>
</Step>
</Steps>

### Organizing Blocks

Keep your library organized:

<Steps>
<Step title="Use descriptive names">
  Name blocks clearly:
  - ✅ "Hero Block"
  - ✅ "Text with Image"
  - ✅ "Card Grid"
  - ❌ "Block 1"
  - ❌ "Test"
</Step>

<Step title="Add descriptions">
  Include descriptions that explain what each block does:
  
  <Example>
  **Name**: "Hero Block"
  **Description**: "Full-width hero section with headline, subheadline, CTA button, and optional background image. Perfect for landing pages."
  </Example>
</Step>

<Step title="Use categories (if available)">
  Group related blocks:
  - **Content**: Text, Image, Video
  - **Layout**: Grid, Columns, Container
  - **Interactive**: Form, Button, CTA
  - **Specialized**: Testimonials, Pricing, FAQ
</Step>
</Steps>

## Reusing Blocks Across Sites

### Adding Blocks to a Site

Once a block is in your library, use it in any site:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open page type editor">
  Go to Page Types and edit the page type where you want to use the block.
</Step>

<Step title="Add available blocks">
  In the "Available Blocks" section, click "Add Block" and select from your library.
</Step>

<Step title="Blocks are now available">
  Editors can now use these blocks when creating pages of this type.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
Blocks in your library are available to all your sites. Create once, use everywhere.
</Check>

### Updating Blocks Globally

When you update a block in your library:

<Steps>
<Step title="Edit the block">
  Make your changes in the Component Library.
</Step>

<Step title="Save changes">
  Click "Save" to update the block.
</Step>

<Step title="Changes apply everywhere">
  All sites using that block get the update automatically.
  
  <Warning>
  Test updates carefully. Breaking changes affect all sites using the block.
  </Warning>
</Step>
</Steps>

### Block Versions

Pala tracks block versions:

- **View history** - See previous versions of a block
- **Revert changes** - Go back to an earlier version if needed
- **Compare versions** - See what changed between versions

<Tip>
Use version history to safely experiment with block changes. You can always revert if something breaks.
</Tip>

## Building a Server Library

### Start with Essentials

Build a core set of blocks:

1. **Hero** - Landing page hero sections
2. **Text** - Rich text content
3. **Image** - Image with optional caption
4. **Card Grid** - Flexible grid layouts
5. **Call-to-Action** - CTA sections
6. **Footer** - Site footer

### Expand Gradually

Add blocks as you need them:

- **Content blocks** - Text, Image, Video, Code
- **Layout blocks** - Grid, Columns, Container, Spacer
- **Interactive blocks** - Form, Button, CTA, Modal
- **Specialized blocks** - Testimonials, Pricing Table, FAQ, Team

### Refine and Improve

Continuously improve your blocks:

- **Add features** - New fields, variants, options
- **Improve styling** - Better responsive design, animations
- **Fix bugs** - Address issues as you find them
- **Optimize** - Better performance, smaller code

<Info>
Your library grows with every project. Blocks you build for one site become reusable assets for future projects.

<Tip>
The marketplace will let you discover blocks built by the community and share your own creations.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

### 1. Build Reusable Blocks

Design blocks to work in multiple contexts by choosing field names carefully:

```svelte
<!-- Good: Flexible and reusable field names -->
<h1 class="hero-{variant}">{headline}</h1>
<!-- Fields: headline, variant (select: default, large, small) -->

<!-- Avoid: Too specific field names -->
<h1>{homepage_headline}</h1>
<!-- Field: homepage_headline (limits reusability) -->
```

Use generic field names like `headline`, `content`, `image` instead of context-specific names like `homepage_headline` or `about_page_content`.

### 2. Document Your Blocks

Add clear descriptions:

<Example>
**Hero Block**
A flexible hero section with headline, subheadline, CTA, and optional background image. Supports multiple variants (default, large, minimal) and works on any page type.
</Example>

### 3. Version Carefully

Test updates before saving:

1. Make changes in the editor
2. Test with preview
3. Check on multiple sites if possible
4. Save when confident

### 4. Organize Early

Start organizing from the beginning:

- Use clear naming conventions
- Add descriptions immediately
- Group related blocks
- Keep a consistent structure

### 5. Reuse and Refine

Don't recreate blocks:

- Check your library first
- Adapt existing blocks when possible
- Improve blocks over time
- Remove unused blocks
