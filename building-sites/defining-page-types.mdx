description: 'Set up page types to control structure, available blocks, and editor guardrails.'
---

Page types are the blueprints that define what kind of pages can exist in your site. They control which blocks editors can use, what page-level fields are available, and what constraints apply. This guide covers everything you need to know about defining effective page types.

## What Are Page Types?

Page types are templates that define:

- **Available blocks** - Which blocks editors can add to pages
- **Required blocks** - Blocks that must appear on every page
- **Page fields** - Metadata like title, description, publish date
- **Constraints** - What editors can and cannot modify
- **URL structure** - How pages of this type are accessed

<Info>
Think of page types as guardrails. They give editors freedom to create content while ensuring designs stay intact and structure remains consistent.
</Info>

## Creating a Page Type

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to page types">
  In your site dashboard, click "Page Types" in the sidebar, then "Create Page Type".
</Step>

<Step title="Set basic information">
  Configure:

  - **Name**: Display name (e.g., "Blog Post", "Default")
  - **Description**: Internal description for your reference
  - **Slug**: URL identifier (e.g., "blog-post", "default")
  
  <Tip>
  The slug determines the URL structure. A page of type "blog-post" will be accessible at `/blog-post/[page-slug]` by default.
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure available blocks">
  Select which blocks from your component library can be used on pages of this type.
  
  <Warning>
  Only blocks you've created in your component library will appear here. Create blocks first, then add them to page types.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Set required blocks (optional)">
  Mark certain blocks as required if they must appear on every page of this type.
  
  <Example>
  A "Blog Post" page type might require a "Header" block at the top and a "Footer" block at the bottom.
  </Example>
</Step>

<Step title="Add page fields">
  Define page-level fields that apply to all pages of this type:
  
  - SEO fields (meta title, description)
  - Publishing fields (publish date, author)
  - Custom metadata (category, tags, featured image)
  
  <Info>
  Page fields are separate from block fields. They apply to the entire page, not individual blocks.
  </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Save the page type">
  Click "Create" to save your page type. It's now available for editors to use when creating pages.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Common Page Type Patterns

### Blog Post

A typical blog post page type:

**Available Blocks:**
- Text (for article content)
- Image (for illustrations)
- Code Block (for code examples)
- Quote (for pull quotes)

**Page Fields:**
- `title` (Text, required) - Post title
- `author` (Text) - Author name
- `publish_date` (Date) - Publication date
- `category` (Select) - Post category
- `tags` (Tags) - Post tags
- `featured_image` (Image) - Featured image
- `excerpt` (Text) - Short description
- `meta_title` (Text) - SEO title
- `meta_description` (Text) - SEO description

**Required Blocks:**
- None (flexibility for different post layouts)

### Product Page

An e-commerce product page:

**Available Blocks:**
- Hero (with product image)
- Text (for description)
- Image Gallery
- Specifications
- Reviews
- Related Products

**Page Fields:**
- `title` (Text, required) - Product name
- `price` (Number) - Product price
- `sku` (Text) - SKU code
- `in_stock` (Boolean) - Stock status
- `category` (Select) - Product category
- `featured_image` (Image) - Main product image
- `meta_title` (Text) - SEO title
- `meta_description` (Text) - SEO description

**Required Blocks:**
- Hero (must have product image)

## Page Fields

Page fields are metadata that applies to the entire page, not individual blocks. Common uses:

### SEO Fields

Every page type should include SEO fields:

- `meta_title` (Text) - Page title for search engines
- `meta_description` (Text) - Page description for search results
- `og_image` (Image, optional) - Social sharing image

### Publishing Fields

For content with publication workflows:

- `publish_date` (Date) - When the page was/will be published
- `author` (Text) - Content author
- `last_updated` (Date, auto) - Last modification date

### Taxonomy Fields

For organizing content:

- `category` (Select) - Single category
- `tags` (Tags) - Multiple tags
- `topic` (Select) - Topic classification

### Custom Metadata

Any additional data you need:

- `featured` (Boolean) - Whether to feature this page
- `priority` (Number) - Display priority
- `external_url` (Text) - Link to external resource

<Example>
A "Team Member" page type might have fields for: name, role, bio, email, social links, and profile photo. These are page-level because they describe the person, not individual blocks on the page.
</Example>

## Available Blocks

### Choosing Which Blocks to Include

Consider what editors need:

- **Too few blocks**: Editors feel constrained, can't create varied content
- **Too many blocks**: Overwhelming, harder to find the right block
- **Just right**: Enough variety for flexibility, but not overwhelming

<Tip>
Start with essential blocks, then add more as needed. You can always edit page types later to add or remove blocks.
</Tip>

<Note>
**Rule of thumb:** 5-10 blocks per page type is usually optimal. More than 15 blocks can be overwhelming for editors.
</Note>

### Block Organization

Group related blocks in your component library to make selection easier:

- **Content blocks**: Text, Image, Video, Code
- **Layout blocks**: Card Grid, Columns, Container
- **Interactive blocks**: Form, Button, CTA
- **Specialized blocks**: Testimonials, Pricing, FAQ

## Required Blocks

Required blocks must appear on every page of a given type. Use them sparingly:

**Good use cases:**
- Header block that must appear at the top
- Footer block that must appear at the bottom
- Navigation block for specific page types

**Avoid requiring:**
- Content blocks (editors need flexibility)
- Multiple blocks (too restrictive)

<Warning>
Required blocks can't be removed by editors. Only mark blocks as required if they're truly essential for every page of that type.
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Best practice:** Start with no required blocks. Add them only if you discover editors consistently need the same block on every page. Flexibility is usually better than constraints.
</Tip>

## URL Structure

Page types influence URL structure:

### Default Behavior

By default, pages follow this pattern:
```
/[page-type-slug]/[page-slug]
```

<Example>
A page of type "blog-post" with slug "my-first-post" would be accessible at `/blog-post/my-first-post`.
</Example>

### Custom URL Patterns

You can configure custom URL patterns in page type settings:

- **Prefix**: Add a prefix to all pages of this type
- **Suffix**: Add a suffix to all pages
- **Custom pattern**: Define your own URL structure

<Info>
URL patterns are configured at the site level, but page types can have their own defaults.
</Info>

## Page Type Settings

### Publishing Workflow

Configure how pages of this type are published:

- **Draft mode**: Pages start as drafts
- **Auto-publish**: Pages publish immediately when saved
- **Scheduled publishing**: Allow scheduling future publication

### Editor Permissions

Control what editors can do:

- **Can duplicate pages**: Allow editors to clone pages
- **Can delete pages**: Allow editors to remove pages
- **Can change page type**: Allow switching between types

<Warning>
Be careful with editor permissions. Restricting certain actions helps maintain site structure and prevents accidental deletions.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Simple

Begin with essential blocks and fields. You can always add more later:

```yaml
Simple Blog Post:
  Blocks: Text, Image
  Fields: title, author, publish_date
```

### 2. Use Descriptive Names

Clear names help editors understand what each page type is for:

- ✅ "Blog Post"
- ✅ "Default"
- ✅ "Team Member Profile"
- ❌ "Type 1"
- ❌ "Generic"

### 3. Document Your Page Types

Add descriptions that explain when to use each type:

<Example>
**Blog Post**: For articles, news, and blog content. Includes author, publish date, and category fields.
</Example>

### 4. Plan for Growth

Consider how page types might evolve:

- Will you need more fields later?
- Will editors need additional blocks?
- Are there related page types you'll create?

### 5. Test with Editors

Get feedback from content editors:

- Are the available blocks sufficient?
- Are page fields clear and useful?
- Is anything missing or confusing?

## Advanced Patterns

### Conditional Blocks

Some page types benefit from conditional block availability:

<Example>
A "Product" page type might show different blocks based on product category. While Pala doesn't support conditional blocks directly, you can create separate page types for different product categories.
</Example>

### Nested Page Types

Create page types that reference other page types:

<Example>
A "Category" page type might include a block that displays pages of type "Blog Post" filtered by category.
</Example>

## Editing Page Types

You can edit page types after creation:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open page type editor">
  Go to Page Types → Select the page type you want to edit.
</Step>

<Step title="Make changes">
  Update:
  - Available blocks (add or remove)
  - Required blocks
  - Page fields
  - Settings
</Step>

<Step title="Save changes">
  Click "Save" to update the page type.
  
  <Warning>
  Changes to page types affect all existing pages of that type. Removing a required block or field may cause issues with existing pages.
  </Warning>
</Step>
</Steps>
